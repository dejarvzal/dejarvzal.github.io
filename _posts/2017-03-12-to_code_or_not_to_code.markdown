I knew I wanted to do something different as a career.  For the past 20 years, I've been focused on the Software, Hardware and Networking support side of the industry.  It was fullfilling, but I wanted something more....something where I can see the tangible result of my actions.  Being the one to resolve an issue for a client is and will always be an awesome feeling for me. Seeing a product created and possibly affecting the lives of many would be a greater feeling of satisfaction.

My interest in software development has always been there since I took my first programming class, Intro to C++, during undergrad.  The Metrocard used to ride the subways in NYC had just come out and our final project in that class was to write the code for the Metrocard.  Though I passed the class, I was so overwhelmed, to chose to not code and took a different path in the industry.  That was almost 20 years ago and through the years, I've always wondered what would have been if I had stayed on that path to software development.

Fast forward to 2016 and the urge to learn software development was so constant, it was no longer a question of whether to code or not.  I had to.  I began to make the time to really see how the transition could happen.  Books from the library on the different programming languages and free online resources allowed me to begin to see the concepts in action and actually write code.  Best decision I've made so far is diving right in and enrolling at the Flatiron school.  It is refreshing being exposed to new things and learning from scratch - it conjurs the same feelings when I travel to a new country and see that culture for the first time.  Right now, almost everything amazes me and it is even more empowering when I resolve a lab and move on to the next lesson.

It is no longer a question - code it is!
